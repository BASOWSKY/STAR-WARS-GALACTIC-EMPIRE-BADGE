# STAR-WARS-GALACTIC-EMPIRE-BADGE
This project is a badge representing the Galactic Empire logo from the Star Wars franchise. There is a capacitive sensing pad in the center of the front badge which when touched starts an animation on the six charliplexed leds on the front, there is also a Buzzer which reproduces the iconic Darth Vader's entrance theme using the technique PCM to PWM. The heart of the badge is a PIC12LF1840. On the bottom overlay is a string "JLCJLCJLCJLC" which allows you to order this PCB from JLCPCB.com to place your order number in that exact position to ensure the front logo is not covered.I recommend EasyEDA.com to design Gerber, is really user Friendly tool.
